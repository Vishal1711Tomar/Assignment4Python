- **If the file does not exist:** It displays a user-friendly error message.

## ✍️ Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

### ✅ Problem Statement:
Create a Python program that:
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `sample.txt`.
2. Appends additional user input to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.

### 🔍 Expected Behavior:
- Takes two inputs from the user.
- Writes and appends them.
